# GGEZChain

**ggezchain** is a next-generation ReFi blockchain ecosystem designed to make
investing in sustainability simple, secure, and accessible on Web3.
At its core, ggezchain empowers the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) â€” turning tangible,
income-generating assets into digital tokens that are easily tradable
and composable across decentralized applications.

By focusing on real-world assets as the most valuable form of collateral,
ggezchain enables individuals and institutions to participate in a new class of asset-backed
cryptocurrencies rooted in sustainable and socially responsible investments.
